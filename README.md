# CV_Highway

Purpose:
- The purpose of this project is to both experiment with computer vision techniques and learn more about Deep Learning as a whole
- The dataset I have used is recorded tapes on a highway near Seattle taken from a camera 

Dataset:
- The dataset I have used is recorded tapes on a highway near Seattle taken from a camera
- The camera has taken about 253 videos on this highway and these videos have been labeled with traffic levels of light, medium or heavy
- info.txt gives us the labels for each of the different highway tapes

Step Zero:
- Use the OpenCV package in python to read and preprocess these videos and prepare them to be modeled
- Extract the labels for each of the videos in order to help train any models I use

Step One:
- Define the archetecture for my 3D-CNN
- Train/Fit the NN on the images and labels 
- Test the accuracy of my CNN

Step Two: 
- This portion will be done with CV2
